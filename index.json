However, heterogeneity of symptom profiles across anxiety disorders, and even within the same diagnoses, have complicated treatment, as treatment success varies widely across patients. Improved mechanistic understanding of the disparate symptoms of anxiety disorders are needed to help inform the development of new treatments. There is a growing understanding that psychiatric disease, including anxiety disorders, results from perturbation of key brain regions and their complex local and regional circuitries. Increasing attention has also been given to the influence of specific genetic polymorphisms and their effects on circuit activity and behavior. This chapter highlights human neuroimaging and rodent studies that parallel one another and illustrate how an integrated approach has advanced understanding of neural circuits implicated in anxiety disorders.","tags":[],"title":"Biological Mechanisms of Anxiety Disorders: Animal and Human Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667174400,"objectID":"b7ba1bafc42f6971b42c0a5350d1f889","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/project/car_macrophage/","publishdate":"2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/car_macrophage/","section":"project","summary":"A team of industry and academic researchers developed a new way to engineer the immune system, leading to the first clinical trial using genetically modified macrophages.","tags":null,"title":"Modifying macrophages to attack solid tumors","type":"project"},{"authors":["Polymnia Georgiou","Panos Zanos","Ta-Chung M Mou","Xiaoxian An","Danielle Gerhard","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"3e9bd030e3fc8fb89fa3e685b5ba0147","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/publication/2022_natneuro/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_natneuro/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the sex of human experimenters affects mouse behaviors and responses following administration of the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine and its bioactive metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine.

This human-male-scent-induced aversion and stress susceptibility was mediated by the activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the entorhinal cortex that project to hippocampal area CA1. Exposure to the scent of male experimenters before ketamine administration activated CA1-projecting entorhinal cortex CRF neurons, and activation of this CRF pathway modulated in vivo and in vitro antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of developmental trajectories in determining early psychiatric outcomes. However, efforts to encourage crosstalk between basic developmental neuroscience and clinical practice are limited. Here, we focus on the potential advantage of considering features of neural circuit development when optimizing treatments for adolescent patient populations. Drawing on characteristics of adolescent neurodevelopment, we highlight two examples, safety cues and incentives, that leverage insights from neural circuit development and may have great promise for augmenting existing behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders during adolescence. This commentary seeks to serve as a framework to maximize the translational potential of basic research in developmental populations for strengthening psychiatric treatments. In turn, input from clinical practice including the identification of age-specific clinically relevant phenotypes will continue to guide future basic research in the same neural circuits to better reflect clinical practices. Encouraging reciprocal communication to bridge the gap between basic developmental neuroscience research and clinical implementation is an important step toward advancing both research and practice in this domain.","tags":[],"title":"The Added Value of Crosstalk Between Developmental Circuit Neuroscience and Clinical Practice to Inform the Treatment of Adolescent Anxiety","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642982400,"objectID":"d143465cdeaaac10b7ecf6f00bf7e89f","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/project/mtdna/","publishdate":"2022-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mtdna/","section":"project","summary":"Recent advancements in mitochondrial genome editing technologies take scientists one step closer to developing viable treatments for mitochondrial diseases, which affect 1 in 4300 adults.","tags":null,"title":"On the Road to Treating Mitochondrial Diseases","type":"project"},{"authors":["Danielle Gerhard","Heidi C.

A consistent finding in the literature is diminished extinction retention in adolescents. However, these studies often directly compare adolescents to adults using a single protocol and therefore provide little insight into learning parameters that improve adolescent fear regulation. Studies in adults highlight the benefits of spaced learning over massed learning. These findings have been extended to fear regulation, with adult rodents exhibiting improved extinction learning and retention when cues are distributed over days versus a single session. However, similar studies have not been performed in adolescents. Here, we systematically examine the impact of trial spacing across days on fear regulation. Adolescent or adult male mice were exposed to one of three extinction paradigms that presented the same number of trials but differed in the temporal distribution of trials across days (one day, two days, or four days). We found that introducing consolidation events into the protocol improves adult extinction learning and short-term extinction retention but these effects disappear after two weeks. For adolescents, all three protocols were comparably effective in reducing freezing across extinction training and improved retention at both short-term and long-term fear recall time points relative to extinction-naive mice. These findings suggest that extinction protocols that incorporate consolidation events are optimal for adults but additional booster training may be required for enduring efficacy. In contrast, protocols incorporating either massed or spaced presentations show immediate and enduring benefits for adolescents.","tags":[],"title":"Extinction trial spacing across days differentially impacts fear regulation in adult and adolescent male mice","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633564800,"objectID":"647ea535f1ff421834a6b116e026c41e","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/project/phage_infographic/","publishdate":"2021-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phage_infographic/","section":"project","summary":"Ultra-microscopic viruses that selectively target and kill bacteria may mitigate antimicrobial resistance.","tags":null,"title":"Infographic: Understanding Bacteriophages","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633478400,"objectID":"31367ba652c603334a51ba0899b0156a","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/project/amr/","publishdate":"2021-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/amr/","section":"project","summary":"Scientists continue to ring alarm bells about the risks associated with the continued misuse of antimicrobials and advocate for innovative treatments, improved surveillance, and greater public health education.","tags":null,"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance: The Silent Pandemic","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1631577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631577600,"objectID":"ed7630c2488758d9ee6d298277f4210d","permalink":"https://daniellegerhard.com/project/telomerase/","publishdate":"2021-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/telomerase/","section":"project","summary":"Scientists found evidence of telomeres in the 1930s, but did not identify them until the 1970s.

As a method for inhibiting fear, safety signals have the potential to augment conventional treatments for anxiety. However, the ability to acquire and use safety signals during adolescence remains unclear. Moreover, the impact of stress on safety learning has received surprisingly little attention given that stress is a major factor preceding anxiety onset. In this study, mice were trained in a discriminative conditioning protocol to facilitate safety learning and were tested for fear inhibition using a conditioned safety signal. Next, independent groups of mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) conditions between postnatal day 22 and 28, followed by tests for anxiety-like phenotypes or fear inhibition using a safety signal, performed either 24 h or five weeks following CUS. Pre-adolescent CUS reduced weight in adolescence and this effect endured into adulthood. CUS also increased specific anxiety-like behaviors in adolescence that were unique from the increase in anxiety observed in adulthood. Despite increased anxiety-like behaviors, adolescents were able to learn about and effectively use safety signals to inhibit fear. In contrast, adults that experienced CUS showed a subtle increase in anxiety but had impaired safety signal learning and usage. Together, these findings indicate that pre-adolescent stress has immediate and enduring effects on anxiety-like behaviors but impairs the capacity for conditioned inhibition only following incubation.","tags":[],"title":"Pre-adolescent stress disrupts adult, but not adolescent, safety learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Santosh Pothula","Taro Kato","Rong-Jian Liu","Min Wu","Danielle Gerhard","Ryota Shinohara","Alexa-Nicole Sliby","Golam M.I.

However, how this bidirectional modulation of NMDARs causes similar antidepressant effects remains unknown. Notably, the initial cellular trigger, specific cell-type(s), and subunit(s) of NMDARs mediating the antidepressant-like effects of a PAM or an antagonist have not been identified. Here, we used electrophysiology, microdialysis, and NMR spectroscopy to evaluate the effect of a NMDAR PAM (rapastinel) or NMDAR antagonist, ketamine on NMDAR function and disinhibition-mediated glutamate release. Further, we used cell-type specific knockdown (KD), pharmacological, and behavioral approaches to dissect the cell-type specific role of GluN2B, GluN2A, and dopamine receptor subunits in the actions of NMDAR PAM vs. antagonists. We demonstrate that rapastinel directly enhances NMDAR activity on principal glutamatergic neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) without any effect on glutamate efflux, while ketamine blocks NMDAR on GABA interneurons to cause glutamate efflux and indirect activation of excitatory synapses. Behavioral studies using cell-type-specific KD in mPFC demonstrate that NMDAR-GluN2B KD on Camk2a- but not Gad1-expressing neurons blocks the antidepressant effects of rapastinel. In contrast, GluN2B KD on Gad1- but not Camk2a-expressing neurons blocks the actions of ketamine. The results also demonstrate that Drd1-expressing pyramidal neurons in mPFC mediate the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine and rapastinel. Together, these results demonstrate unique initial cellular triggers as well as converging effects on Drd1-pyramidal cell signaling that underlie the antidepressant actions of NMDAR-positive modulation vs. NMDAR blockade.","tags":[],"title":"Cell-type specific modulation of NMDA receptors triggers antidepressant actions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Farhan Ali","Ling-Xiao Shao","Danielle Gerhard","Katherine Sweasy","Santosh Pothula","Christopher Pittenger","Ronald S.

Most studies of SHANK3 in the neocortex and hippocampus have focused on disturbances in pyramidal neurons. However, GABAergic interneurons likewise receive excitatory inputs and presumably would also be a target of constitutive SHANK3 perturbations. In this study, we characterize the prefrontal cortical microcircuit in awake mice using subcellular-resolution two-photon microscopy. We focused on a nonsense R1117X mutation, which leads to truncated SHANK3 and has been linked previously to cortical dysfunction. We find that R1117X mutants have abnormally elevated calcium transients in apical dendritic spines. The synaptic calcium dysregulation is due to a loss of dendritic inhibition via decreased NMDAR currents and reduced firing of dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABAergic interneurons. Notably, upregulation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in SST interneurons corrects the excessive synaptic calcium signals and ameliorates learning deficits in R1117X mutants. These findings reveal dendrite-targeting interneurons, and more broadly the inhibitory control of dendritic spines, as a key microcircuit mechanism compromised by the SHANK3 dysfunction.","tags":[],"title":"Inhibitory regulation of calcium transients in prefrontal dendritic spines is compromised by a nonsense Shank3 mutation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danielle Gerhard","Santosh Pothula","Rong-Jian Liu","Min Wu","Xiao-Yuan Li","Matthew J.

To address this question, we used a combination of viral shRNA and conditional mutation to produce cell-specific knockdown or deletion of a key NMDAR subunit, GluN2B, implicated in the actions of ketamine. The results demonstrated that the antidepressant actions of ketamine were blocked by GluN2B-NMDAR knockdown on GABA (Gad1) interneurons, as well as subtypes expressing somatostatin (Sst) or parvalbumin (Pvalb), but not glutamate principle neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Further analysis of GABA subtypes showed that cell-specific knockdown or deletion of GluN2B in Sst interneurons blocked or occluded the antidepressant actions of ketamine and revealed sex-specific differences that are associated with excitatory postsynaptic currents on mPFC principle neurons. These findings demonstrate that GluN2B-NMDARs on GABA interneurons are the initial cellular trigger for the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine and show sex-specific adaptive mechanisms to GluN2B modulation.","tags":[],"title":"GABA interneurons are the cellular trigger for ketamine's rapid antidepressant actions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Farhan Ali","Danielle Gerhard","Katherine Sweasy","Santosh Pothula","Christopher Pittenger","Ronald S.

In prefrontal cortex, the prevailing disinhibition hypothesis posits that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine act preferentially on GABAergic neurons. However, cortical interneurons are heterogeneous. In particular, somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons selectively inhibit dendrites and regulate synaptic inputs, yet their response to systemic NMDAR antagonism is unknown. Here, we report that ketamine acutely suppresses the activity of SST interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of the awake mouse. The deficient dendritic inhibition leads to greater synaptically evoked calcium transients in the apical dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. By manipulating NMDAR signaling via GluN2B knockdown, we show that ketamine’s actions on the dendritic inhibitory mechanism has ramifications for frontal cortex-dependent behaviors and cortico-cortical connectivity. Collectively, these results demonstrate dendritic disinhibition and elevated calcium levels in dendritic spines as important local-circuit alterations driven by the administration of subanesthetic ketamine.","tags":[],"title":"Ketamine disinhibits dendrites and enhances calcium signals in prefrontal dendritic spines","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the effects of conventional monoamine-based antidepressants, but the role of VEGF in the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine remains unclear. The authors examined whether neuronal VEGF signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine. The authors used a combination of approaches, including conditional, neuron-specific knockout of VEGF or its receptor, Flk-1; antibody neutralization; viral-mediated knockdown of Flk-1; and pharmacological inhibitors. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to examine whether neuronal VEGF signaling was required for the neurotrophic and synaptogenic actions of ketamine that underlie its behavioral actions. The behavioral actions of systemic ketamine are blocked by forebrain excitatory neuron-specific deletion of either VEGF or Flk-1 or by intra-mPFC infusion of a VEGF neutralizing antibody. Moreover, intra-mPFC infusions of VEGF are sufficient to produce rapid ketamine-like behavioral actions, and these effects are blocked by neuron-specific Flk-1 deletion. The results also show that local knockdown of Flk-1 in mPFC excitatory neurons in adulthood blocks the behavioral effects of systemic ketamine. Moreover, inhibition of neuronal VEGF signaling blocks the neurotrophic and synaptogenic effects of ketamine. Together, these findings indicate that neuronal VEGF–Flk-1 signaling in the mPFC plays an essential role in the antidepressant actions of ketamine.","tags":[],"title":"Role of neuronal VEGF signaling in the prefrontal cortex in the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danielle Gerhard","David A.

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, increases BDNF release and synaptic connectivity, opposing the deficits caused by chronic stress and depression. Efforts are focused on the development of novel rapid agents that produce similar synaptic and rapid antidepressant actions, but without the side effects of ketamine. The impact of gender on the response to ketamine and other rapid-acting antidepressants is in early stages of investigation.The discovery that ketamine produces rapid therapeutic actions for depression and suicidal ideation represents a major breakthrough and much needed alternative to currently available medications.

Although cacna1c heterozygous (HET) mice have been previously reported to exhibit an antidepressant-like phenotype, the molecular and circuit-level dysfunction remains unknown. Here we report that viral vector-mediated deletion of cacna1c in the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice recapitulates the antidepressant-like effect observed in cacna1c HET mice using the sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). Molecular studies identified lower levels of REDD1, a protein previously linked to depression, in the PFC of HET mice, and viral-mediated REDD1 overexpression in the PFC of these HET mice reversed the antidepressant-like effect in SPT and TST. Examination of downstream REDD1 targets found lower levels of active/phosphorylated Akt (S473) with no change in mTORC1 phosphorylation. Examination of the transcription factor FoxO3a, previously linked to depression-related behavior and shown to be regulated in other systems by Akt, revealed higher nuclear levels in the PFC of cacna1c HET mice that was further increased following REDD1-mediated reversal of the antidepressant-like phenotype. Collectively, these findings suggest that REDD1 in cacna1c HET mice may influence depression-related behavior via regulation of the FoxO3a pathway. Cacna1c HET mice thus serve as a useful mouse model to further study cacna1c-associated molecular signaling and depression-related behaviors relevant to human CACNA1C genetic variants.","tags":[],"title":"Cacna1c in the prefrontal cortex regulates depression-related behaviors via REDD1","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric S.

The impact of MDD is compounded by the limited therapeutic efficacy and delay of weeks to months of currently available medications. These issues highlight the need for more efficacious and faster-acting treatments to alleviate the burdens of MDD. Recent breakthroughs demonstrate that certain drugs, including ketamine and scopolamine, produce rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in MDD patients. Moreover, preclinical work has shown that the antidepressant actions of ketamine and scopolamine in rodent models are caused by an increase of extracellular glutamate, elevated BDNF, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) cascade, and increased number and function of spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we review studies showing that both ketamine and scopolamine elicit rapid antidepressant effects through converging molecular and cellular mechanisms in the PFC. In addition, we discuss evidence that selective antagonists of NMDA and muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor subtypes (i.e., NR2B and M1-AChR) in the PFC produce comparable antidepressant responses. Furthermore, we discuss evidence that ketamine and scopolamine antagonize inhibitory interneurons in the PFC leading to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and increased extracellular glutamate that promotes the rapid antidepressant responses to these agents. Collectively, these studies indicate that specific NMDA and mACh receptor subtypes on GABAergic interneurons are promising targets for novel rapid-acting antidepressant therapies.","tags":[],"title":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of rapid-acting antidepressants ketamine and scopolamine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric S.

Here, we demonstrate that the antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine are mediated by GABA interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Both GABAergic (GAD67+) interneurons and glutamatergic (CaMKII+) interneurons in the mPFC expressed M1-AChR. In mice, viral-mediated knockdown of M1-AChR specifically in GABAergic neurons, but not glutamatergic neurons, in the mPFC attenuated the antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine. Immunohistology and electrophysiology showed that somatostatin (SST) interneurons in the mPFC express M1-AChR at higher levels than parvalbumin interneurons. Moreover, knockdown of M1-AChR in SST interneurons in the mPFC demonstrated that M1-AChR expression in these neurons is required for the rapid antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine.

Additional experiments revealed that dietary curcumin is also effective at impairing the reconsolidation of an older, well-consolidated fear memory. Furthermore, we observed that fear memories that fail to reconsolidate under the influence of dietary curcumin are impaired in an enduring manner; unlike extinguished fear memories, they are not subject to reinstatement or renewal.

To rule out pre-existing differences between dominants and subordinates, we examined whether 14 days of dominance experience is required to reduce the conditioned defeat response and whether the development of conditioned defeat resistance correlates with defeat-induced neural activation in select brain regions. We paired hamsters in daily 5-min aggressive encounters for 1, 7, or 14 days and then exposed animals to 3, 5-min social defeat episodes. The next day animals received conditioned defeat testing which involved a 5-min social interaction test with a non-aggressive intruder. In separate animals brains were collected after social defeat for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We found that 14-day dominants showed a decreased conditioned defeat response compared to 14-day subordinates and controls, while 1-day and 7-day dominants did not differ from their subordinate counterparts. Also, the duration of dominance relationship was associated with distinct patterns of defeat-induced neural activation such that only 14-day dominants showed elevated c-Fos immunoreactivity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, medial amygdala, and lateral portions of the ventral medial hypothalamus.
